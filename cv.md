3. My goal is to receive new skills in WEB-development to realize myself. I prefer detailed analysis of materials and work at full capacity.
   I have little experience, but there was a time, when I made nice pages using HTML and CSS. I tried to make a layout for the site in Photoshop. I have great experience of participating in the volunteer movement at large-scale events (f.e. The 2nd European Games 2019, The Match Europe v USA 2019).
4. I know basic HTML, CSS, JS and C++ a little.
5. ```
    const reverse = (str) => {
      let i = str.length - 1;
      let result = '';
      while (i >= 0) {
        result = `${result}${str[i]}`;
        i = i - 1;
      }
      return result;
    };
